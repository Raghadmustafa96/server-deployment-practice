### notes for today :

> today we learned more thing about server-side

* how to make modularity, we need to have (module. expert) in every file want to export(this should equal to whatever  want to the public)
and require it on another file

* we knew about the postman (tool help to make HTTP Request to your server  without using the browser)

* we learned about TDD (Test Driven Development ) the idea for it we write the test before you write your code. we do the test will be failed, then we implemented the function and refactor the code or test to make it passed. (automated testing)
we use something called jest(js testing framework ) to help us to write some assertion for our app. (open source library)
